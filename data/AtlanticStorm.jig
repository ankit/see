    <docText>Information was requested of Belgian intelligence by the FBI on 1 September about Pieter Dopple, who lives at 22 Hoveniersstraat, Antwerp, Belgium. He sent the diamonds to Adnan Hijazi as noted in the USCBP report of 12 July, 2004. Belgian intelligence reports that Dopple has been under surveillance as a fence for diamonds obtained by groups, many of them associated with Islamic ventures, in various places in Africa. It appears that Dopple receives raw diamonds and other precious stones such as tanzanite and cuts and polishes them for distribution. Dopple receives a fee for his services but does not sell the stones himself. He sends them where his suppliers specify. At his interrogation, Dopple admitted that he was part of a scheme for transferring funds for militant Islamic groups and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He listed several persons in addition to Hijazi to whom he had sent polished diamonds and tanzanite. One person he named was Ramundo Ortiz, who runs a business in Panama City, Panama. He further said that he had just sent about $150,000 in polished diamonds to Ortiz on 25 September. Asked for the identity of the person(s) who had requested this transaction, he could only say that they were from Peshawar in Pakistan.</docText>

Both men spoke perfect English and were very cordial. But they refused to answer any questions and asked to be represented by an attorney. They were fingerprinted and held in custody. Further examination of documents in their possession when they were apprehended revealed a letter, written in Arabic, from a person named Abdul Nasser. This letter was addressed to a person named Ali al-Omari. This letter simply said: "Go forth with Allah's blessing. You have been my best student." Investigation of these two men continues.</docText>

    <docText>The FBI informant who attends meetings of God's Aryan Militia [GAM] in Texas reports having recorded a conversation between Khalid Shamrani [see FBI Report: 20 November, 2003] and three other men, two of whom the informant identified as Billy Jack Hawkins and Slade Goodman, both of whom are members of GAM. The third person our informant could only identify as a Middle Easterner named "Hafs" or "Halfs". This was the name given him by Shamrani. The gist of this conversation, which took place at the Westerner Motel on Almeda-Genoa Rd. in Houston, was that actions involving destructive activities in the Houston area and elsewhere would be placed on hold for at least several months. They discussed the apprehension of a militia member named Walter Smith and another person named al Quso in Kansas City. The fear they expressed was that their actions were being compromised.</docText>

    <docText>The bail bond company BailOut in Charlotte NC forfeited the $10,000 bail bond it guaranteed for Rifai Qasim [alias Omar Blakely] in connection with the theft charge against him [see FBI Report 25 October, 2003]. When this bail bond company's investigators failed to locate Qasim/Blakely after four weeks, they turned the matter over to the FBI. Qasim and his associate Muhammed Mustafa closed their joint bank account at the Carolina First Bank on 23 October, 2003 and fled in a 1997 Toyota Tercel, NC license # TQE-732. A 1997 Toyota Tercel bearing this license number was found abandoned in River Rouge Park in Detroit, MI on 15 December, 2003. Overlooked in the initial examination of this vehicle by Detroit police, but later found by FBI investigators, was a slip of paper with a phone number on it. The phone number is listed in the name Abdul al Nami, who resides at 562 Fenkell Ave. in Detroit, MI. Acting on information obtained in DIA Report 5 March, 2004, a court-sanctioned tap was placed on this phone. On 15 May, 2004 a call was placed from this phone to a residence at 237 Hayes Ave in Detroit. The caller said: "Rifai, we are all together now. We will let you know when the match will be played. It might take some time to get the right field." The person receiving the call says: "I hope it will not be too long, my side is really ready to play." Investigators went to the residence at 237 Hayes Ave. on 20 May, 2004 and found it to be unoccupied. Neighbors said that the two Middle Eastern men who had occupied this residence briefly had moved out just a few days earlier. The owner of this residence, a Mr. Howard Clark, said he had evicted the two men because they failed to pay their rent for two months. Clark did not know where they went.</docText>

    <docText>Information received from MI 5 regarding Raeed Beandali, an American citizen who was listed on Al Qaeda rosters [see CIA report 15 Feb. 2003]. According to this roster, Beandali was sent from Afghanistan to London on 12 December, 2002. MI 5 tells us that a man was arrested in London on 10 February, 2004 for carrying an unregistered British driver's license. The name on this license was Reginald Cooper and the address given on this license was # 12 Lavender Grove, Hackney, London. When he was arrested, Cooper told police constables that he lived alone with his old Mum at this address. Inquiries made at 12 Lavender Grove revealed that it was occupied by several men, one of whom was identified by neighbors as a "nice American" who called himself Ralph Bean. An assortment of materials for constructing explosive devices were found in a shed behind this residence. Reginald Cooper was subsequently identified as Mahmud al-Dahab, an Egyptian who had been living in London for about 15 years. Asked where Ralph Bean was to be found, all Cooper [al Dahab] would say is; "He went home". Checks with airlines revealed that a Ralph Bean, traveling on an American passport, left London Heathrow on 16 March, 2004 for Detroit MI.</docText>

    <docText>Further information regarding Saeed al Nami and and Riyad al Taifi who were apprehended on 26 December, 2003 during a robbery attempt in Arlington, Texas [see FBI report 2 January, 2004]. Both of these individuals are Saudis who came to Buenos Aires, Argentina in January of 2001. They are both wanted by the police in Buenos Aires for their role in the bombing of a Jewish synagogue in Buenos Aires in April of 2002. Escaping apprehension, they went to Calamar, Columbia in May, 2002,  where they are now known to have been active in collaborating with the ELN. In January, 2003 they came to the USA following a route taken by other Islamic militants known to have come into the USA. This route took them from Calamar to Cartagena in Columbia and then by boat to Guane in Cuba. They then went by boat from Guane, Cuba to Chetumal, Mexico. From Chetumal they traveled to Mexico City and then on to the border town of Ojinaga, where they were smuggled into Presidio, Texas. In Ojinaga they were both supplied with Texas driver's licenses and U.S. currency by a person whose name they said they could not remember. They went by bus to Ft. Stockton, San Antonio, and then on to the Dallas area. A search of their apartment at 2727 Robinson Rd. in Grand Prairie, Texas revealed an assortment of automatic weapons and the addresses of two men known to be associated with God's Aryan Militia in Texas. These men are Billy Jack Hawkins, 1212 Pipeline Rd., Euless, Texas, and Slade Goodman of 899 Almeda-Genoa Rd. in Houston, Texas.</docText>

    <docText>Jamal al Shibh, of Yemeni origin, has been the Imam at the Tawhid Mosque in Miami, Florida for the past ten years. As a result of recent reports provided by informants about al Shibh's call for jihad in America, he has been under surveillance. He was photographed on 2 February, 2004, on the University of Miami campus in Coral Gables, distributing literature, written in Arabic, at various locations known to be frequented by Islamic students. This literature describes how well the city of Miami illustrates that America has become a sink of vice and corruption. Examples are provided of the easy availability of sex and drugs in the Miami area. This literature also calls for immediate jihadic action in order to prevent the corruption of Muslims in America. Especially singled out in this literature is the tourist industry in the Miami area.</docText>

    <docText>Based on the information about Wali Shakur, noted in the FBI report of 27 November, 2003, agents were sent to interview him at the 224 Paulson Ave. Clifton NJ address given in this report. Before this interview information was obtained about Shakur's background. He is an American citizen, having been born in 1970 in New Brunswick, NJ of parents who were immigrants from Pakistan in 1965. Shakur attended Rutgers University for two years , dropping out in 1990 in order to study at the American University in Beirut, Lebanon. He returned to the USA in 1993. Shakur was shown a copy of the e-mail he had received from either Ahmed Doha or Abu Ayyash on 3 November, 2003. He was also asked what the 4,000 in this message referred to. Shakur replied that both Doha and Ayyash were students at the University of Missouri and were good friends of his father and that he, Shakur, did not know them personally. Shakur said that his father had in 2001 loaned them $8,000 and had not yet received any payment on this loan. Shakur said he requested at least half payment on this loan and later received a Western Union wire of $4,000 from Doha. Shakur said he gave the cash to his father. Asked for his father's address, Shakur said his father had died on 2 January, 2004. Shakur's activities remain the subject of FBI investigations.</docText>

    <docText>On 20 June, 2003, three men were arrested at # 71 Voorburg straat in Amsterdam. All three men were of Indonesian origin and had emigrated to The Netherlands in the mid 1990s. These men were arrested on evidence that they had formed a plan to destroy a number of Jewish synagogues in Amsterdam and in other places in The Netherlands. One person was identified as being of special interest to us; his name was established as Riduan Sungkar, who was born in Kuala Lumpur in 1974.

    <docText>On 26 December, 2003 two men were arrested during a robbery attempt at the FirstTex Bank at 435 Fielder Rd. in Arlington, Texas. The two men, both wearing ski masks, were apprehended by Arlington police as they fled from the bank. The men were identified as Saeed al Nami and Riyad al Taifi, both living at 2727 Robinson Rd, Apartment 6, in Grand Prairie, Texas. Each one had a Texas driver's license that was forged, and neither could produce a passport of any kind. They both said they had entered the USA from Mexico at Presidio, Texas and had come to Mexico by way of Central America from Columbia. Both spoke perfect English and were unemployed at the time. An investigation of their residence revealed money in bags identified as belonging to several other banks in the Dallas area. The total amount in the bags amounted to $42,010. In addition, there were small arms of various sorts and literature concerning jihad activities. They rented this apartment from a woman named Ruth Tucker, who said that they had lived in this apartment for three months, had never caused any trouble, and paid their rent on time. She also said that they had told her they were students at the University of Texas in Arlington. One item of mail was discovered in their apartment; it was a letter written in Arabic from a person named A. Doman who gave a return address on the envelope as 231 12th St. in Columbia, MO.</docText>

    <docText>A number of bombings were attempted in Casablanca on 16 May, 2003. Of five attempts only one succeeded in causing mass casualties. In four of the attempts that failed only the bombers were killed. These bombings are believed to have been the actions of local individuals who may have been trained by Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. A person believed to have been a participant in the successful bombing was apprehended on 18 June, 2003; his name is Mohamed Essabar. On interrogation, Essabar was asked to reveal the names of other participants, which, even under duress, he refused to do. However, when he was arrested he was carrying a note in Arabic signed by a person named A. Atmani. One person of interest having this name is Abdellah Atmani, who has been a resident of Casablanca all his life. During interviews with Atmani, it became clear that he had no part in the bombings on 16 May, 2003. However, his name was brought to our attention because Atmani works as a loading supervisor for the Holland Orange Shipping Lines that has offices and docks in Casablanca. Holland Orange ships make regular freight runs from Casablanca to a variety of locations along the east coast of the USA as well as to places in the Caribbean. Moroccan police reported that they were keeping Atmani under surveillance.</docText>

    <docText>A tip from an anonymous source directed investigators to a residence at 2111 Troost Ave. in Kansas City, Missouri. This source said that explosives were being manufactured at this residence by some terrorists who intended to blow up several buildings in the Kansas City Area. A warrant was obtained to search this residence on evidence provided by an examination of items found in garbage sacks that were picked up by an FBI officer posing as a garbage collector. Traces of chemicals necessary to produce explosives were found on items in this garbage. When this residence was searched on 22 December, 2003, one man, who gave his name as Walter Smith, was the only person at home. While the investigation was proceeding, another man entered and was apprehended. Subsequent identity checks revealed this man to be Jamal al Quso, who had come from Chicago to Kansas City. What was found at this residence were batches of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine [HMTD] and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine [RDX], both primary explosives. Also found were three garbage sacks full of urea and aluminum sulfate. In later investigations of this residence, detailed drawings were found of three popular casinos in the Kansas City area: the Argosy Riverside Casino, the Isle of Capri Casino, and Harrah's Casino.</docText>

Unfortunately, apparently being tipped-off, the occupants had fled the day before. However, in the mess they left behind, there were a few items of interest. One was an expired Pakistani passport issued to a person named Yasir Salman. Other items included a doctor's stethoscope; notes taken in Arabic on Legionella and gastroenteritis; and notes, written in Arabic, about the results of a May, 2002 project in the USA called TOPOFF I. In addition, an opened envelope addressed in Arabic to F. Badawi was found behind a cabinet in one of the rooms in this house. Finally, a note written in Arabic simply stated: "Karachi, March 10, 2003, Safrygin, funds."</docText>

    <docText>In response to a request, the FBI searched its files for information on subjects having the initials J. T. [in Detroit, MI], A. H. [in Newark, NJ], and M. M. [in Laurel, MD]. Eight persons with initials J.T. were discovered in Detroit, but all these persons are known to the police and have no interesting information in their files. One person was identified with the initials A. H. in Newark; his name is Adnan Hijazi. Hijazi had been interviewed by the FBI following the 9/11/01 attacks. He was cleared of any association with these events and presently has no other entries on his record. There are just two persons in FBI files for Laurel, MD with initials M. M. One is Martha Mason and her file reveals that she was convicted on 21 January, 2002 for the distribution of narcotics; she is now incarcerated. The other is Mounir Mzoudi, of Moroccan descent, who holds a degree from Baltimore City College, which he obtained in 1994. Mzoudi currently lives at 2116 27th St. in Laurel, MD. Mzoudi recently attracted the attention of the FBI because, according to a source in Baltimore, Mzoudi  had a past association with an organization called the Islamic Circle of North America [ICNA]. He attended a meeting of ICNA held in Baltimore from June 20 to July 2, 2000. ICNA quite openly supported the Taliban at this time.</docText>

    <docText>In response to our query about other associates of Omar Mahmoud Othman at the Baker St. Mosque in London, MI 5 responded with information that a man named Omar Hanif had been given employment by Othman at this mosque in the period 1993 - 1998. He left the UK for a year in 1999 and was possibly in Afghanistan. Travel records show that he traveled from London Heathrow to Islamabad in February of 1999 and returned to London from there in December, 1999. Hanif holds a valid British passport and now lives at #11 Apple St. in Nassau, The Bahamas. He is employed by a chain of hotels in the Bahamas and works at the Seashore Hotel in Nassau and, occasionally, at the Freeport Star Hotel in Freeport. Another name mentioned by MI 5 to be associated with Othman was Jamal al Quso, who came to the UK from Yemen in 1993. He applied for British citizenship in 1998 but was refused because of his repeated troubles with the law. He was convicted of inciting to riot in 1996 and served a one-year suspended sentence. Records reveal that he left London Heathrow on a flight to Chicago, Illinois on July 17, 1999.</docText>

    <docText>Ahmed Doha and Abu Ayyash are both registered as graduate students at the University of Missouri in Columbia, MO. Both Doha and Ayyash have Saudi student visas issued in July, 2001.  Doha was charged with filing a fraudulent insurance claim. On 10 October, 2003 Doha filed a claim with Ayyash's insurance company, Central Farmers Auto Insurance Co., for a back injury he said he suffered on 12 September, 2003 when his car was struck from behind by one driven by Ayyash. Doha's insurance company is the Mid States Insurance Company. Both the Mid States and Central Farmers representatives who subsequently investigated the accident and who handled this claim both stated that Doha and Ayyash said they did not know each other. Doha was paid $11,000 in settlement of this claim on 1 November, 2003 by Central Farmer's Insurance Company. A check of the records at Mid States and Central Farmers insurance companies reveals that both Doha and Ayyash paid for their auto insurance policies from the same account at the Columbia First State Bank. On a valid search warrant, Doha's apartment at 231 12th St. in Columbia was searched on 20 November, 2003 and it was discovered that Ayyash also lives in this apartment. A Dell laptop computer at this residence was taken by the police. Also taken were CDs containing a 7,000 page version of the Encyclopedia of Jihad. The computer, when examined, revealed e-mail messages to and from over 100 addresses in the USA. Many of these messages seemed to involve only personal and academic matters. But one message that attracted attention was sent on 3 November, 2003 to an AOL address for a person identified as wshakur. This message read: "4,000 you requested sent by wire today." This e-mail address belongs to Wali Shakur, who lives at 224 Paulson Ave. in Clifton, NJ. Both Hamas and Al Qaeda are known to have a presence in Columbia, MO. An investigation continues regarding the possible association of Doha and Ayyash with these groups.</docText>

    <docText>Among the persons under surveillance for possible Al Qaeda associations in the USA is Khalid Shamrani, a Saudi national who lives and works in Houston, Texas for the TexEast Petroleum Co. Shamrani has held a work visa since April, 2000. Suspicion first fell on Shamrani as a result of his attendance at a meeting of God's Aryan Militia in Denton, Texas on 12 March, 2003. He attended another meeting of this militia group in Mineral Wells, Texas on 16 June, 2003. An FBI informant who attends the meetings of this militia group developed a friendship with Shamrani and was invited to his home at 3236 Pine St. in Bellaire, Texas. The informant says he there saw elaborate diagrams of the Houston Ship Channel and detailed plans for Reliant Stadium and the Galleria Shopping Mall in Houston. The informant also said that Shamrani revealed his association with an Islamic group that had many of the same objectives as God's Aryan Militia including the elimination of Zioni st influence on the US government. The informant also reported that Shamrani said there would be "big events" in Houston, Chicago and in other places during the next year, but he did not elaborate on the nature of these events.</docText>

    <docText>On 1 November, 2003 Mousa Salah, of no fixed address in Herndon, VA., was arrested at Dulles International Airport as he attempted to board a flight to London Heathrow. At the time of his arrest he was using a Jordanian passport in the name Shadi abu Hoshar. Salah has been wanted in connection with Hamas fund-raising and other activities in Northern Virginia. It is believed that Salah entered the USA illegally from Windsor, Canada into Detroit, MI in 2002. Salah was in possession of a Virginia driver's license # T21-23-8820 registered in the name Mousa Salah. Virginia DOT records show that this same license number was issued on 10 August, 2001 to a woman named April Stevens of Roanoke, VA. Ms Stevens is not the subject of further investigations; she teaches kindergarten classes in Roanoke. The address shown on Salah's driver's license does not exist. Several numbers and initials were written on the back of an envelope in possession of Salah at the time of his arrest; they are: (i) J. T., Detroit, (ii) A. H., Newark, (iii) M. M., Laurel.</docText>

    <docText>Mohamed al Omari is a Saudi who was apprehended by Pakistani police in Peshawar on 12 January 2003. Omari was badly wounded at the time, saying that he was shot while attempting to desert from an Al Qaeda insurgent group that had taken refuge near Parachinar on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Omari was placed in a hospital and, after his recovery, he was encouraged to talk about his Al Qaeda activities. Among the items of information Omari revealed was that he had been at the Farooq training facility in 2001 before the American presence in Afghanistan. He was shown photos of various persons and asked if he could identify any of them. One photo, that had been taken in Peshawar on 2 January, 2003, showed a group of four men. Omari said he knew three of them since they had been with him at the Farooq training camp. One man he identified as Dr. Badawi, the second he identified as Mamdouh al Hazmi, and the third he identified only as Hasham; Omari could not remember his first name. Omari said that all three were members of Al Qaeda.</docText>

    <docText>On 2 April, 2003 the Surete' de l'Etat issued a bulletin concerning a Moroccan named Abdillah Zinedine [alias: Abu Hafs] who had, among others, been occupying a house at 73 Rue Duhesme. Zinedine had been wanted in connection with an attempt to blow up (faire sauter) the Amercan Embassy in Paris in the Fall of 2001. Zinedine is an explosives expert who was in Afghanistan from 1997 - 2000 and who provided Al Qaeda  members with explosives training at the Al Badr II training camp in the Pakhtia province area of Afghanistan. It has recently been learned that Zinedine left Paris on a flight to Montreal, Canada on 1 April, 2003. He was using a fraudulent French passport in the name Mehdi Rafiki. Another occupant of the house at 73 Rue Duhesme, on interrogation, reported that Abu Hafs, as he knew Zinedine, said he was on his way to Chicago to visit an old friend whom he only identified as Murad. This source, identified as another Moroccan Zakarya Ziyad, said that Zinedine had mentioned that he and Murad would be doing "great things" in several cities in America.</docText>

    <docText>Regarding Jamal al Quso, who was said by MI 5 to have come from London to Chicago in 1999 [see CIA report for 16 May, 2003], the Chicago FBI field office responded by reporting that a Jamal al Quso had landed at O'Hare Airport on July 18, 1999 using a British passport in his name. A check with USCIS reveals no evidence that he ever left the USA since his arrival. In addition, the name Jamal al Quso has been associated by an informant with Islamic Jihad, which is known to have a presence in Chicago. On 28 September, 2003 a house at 2211 Cermak Rd. in Chicago, said by the informer to be occupied by members of Islamic Jihad, was raided by an FBI team acting under a warrant. One person, Abdul Murad, was the only person at this residence at the time of the raid. Thirty kilos, of C-4 plastic explosives were found at this residence along with an additional 25 kilos of Semtex. Maps of O'Hare Airport and diagrams of the Sears Tower were also confiscated. Murad, now being held, has refused to say who the other occupants of this residence are. However, on a notepad found in the room Quso possibly occupied at this residence was listed the message [in Arabic]: "Jamal, call Khalid S., Texas, tomorrow for sure." Jamal al Quso's present location is not known.</docText>

    <docText>In identifying the presence of possible Hezbollah members in the Charlotte NC area, the name Rifai Qasim, has recently surfaced. An Egyptian passport in the name of Rifai Qasim was found recently on the floor of the Southern Trailways bus depot in Charlotte, NC. Examined by the Charlotte police, the picture on this passport matches the appearance of a person using the name Omar Blakely, who was charged with the theft, on 1 October, 2003, of several items [total value: $3000] from an electronics supply store in Charlotte. Blakely gave his address as: 3131 Western Ave. in Charlotte. Blakely is now out on bail that was guaranteed by a bail bond company named BailOut, in Charlotte, NC. The $2,000 that this bond cost was paid by a check written on an account at the Carolina First Bank held jointly in the names: Omar Blakely and Muhammed Mustafa. Bank records reveal periodic deposits to this account, usually in the amount of $3000, from an account at the First Emirate Bank in Dubai, UAE. The Carolina First Bank account in the name of Blakely and Mustafa was closed on 23 October, 2003 and the house at 3131 Western Ave is now unoccupied. However, a search through this abandoned house revealed the envelopes of several letters addressed to Rifai Qasim.</docText>

This source said he believes that Escalante works in some capacity for the Cuban military.

During this conversation the Spanish ambassador mentioned that an entire family, of the name al Ghamdi, had worked at the Spanish embassy in Riyadh from 1970 to 1988. The ambassador went on to say that he had worked at this embassy as a clerk during this time and had become attached to the three al Ghamdi sons. He added with regret that all three of the boys, whom he had watched grow up, left Saudi Arabia and that two of them had been killed fighting for Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The third son, he added, never returned to Saudi Arabia and the last he heard was that he had taken up residence in Santo Domingo and was now a cab driver.</docText>

The package instead contained 111 polished diamonds, whose value is estimated to be $47,000. Discussions with the FBI resulted in a decision not to pursue a customs violation charge against HIjazi. The reason is that HIjazi is currently under FBI surveillance. This package was resealed and delivered to HIjazi by USPS.</docText>

    <docText>In the CIA Report for 13 February, 2004 it was noted that Pakistani intelligence had agreed to keep a residence at 631 Nishtar Rd. in Karachi under surveillance. On 17 September, 2004 they reported to us that events had prompted a raid on this residence on 5 September, 2004. During this raid five persons were killed, among them two police officers. The three others killed were identified as: Abdul Jabarah [a Kuwaiti], Fahd Jehani [a Saudi], and Ramzi al Shibh [a Yemeni], all of whom are known members of Al Qaeda. Jehani seems to have been a courier since he was carrying a packet of messages. Most of the messages contained instructions for insurgent activities in Pakistan, including an attempt to be made on 1 October, 2004 to destroy police HQ in Karachi. But one message was addressed to S. H in Chitral that read; "Allah, all praise to him, has provided the funds you need to finish your work. These funds will be on their way in ten days." This message was sent by a person only identified as Moataz [possibly an alias] and was sent from Gwadar, Pakistan.</docText>

    <docText>On 3 August, 2004 two men were apprehended at the Longhorn Motel in Carrizo Springs, TX. The motel owner, Mike Sanders, said he became suspicious of the two because of the identification they presented when they registered at his motel on 2 August, 2004. One of the men presented a Texas driver's license having a picture that seemed fuzzy. In addition, they listed a Texas car license as KHZ - 116. Sanders allowed the men to stay but made note of the address on the driver's license: 2233 Fannin St. in Uvalde, TX. Sanders informed the USCBP office in Laredo who verified that there is no such address in Uvalde, TX. In addition, there was no car in the motel's parking lot having the license plate KHZ - 116. When interviewed by USCPB officers, one of the men said their car had obviously been stolen from the motel's parking lot. Most probably, the two men had crossed the border in the vicinity of Piedras Negras and Eagle Pass. They were held for questioning. Examination of their luggage revealed several documents written in Arabic, that included instructions about how to make sarin gas and ricin.</docText>

    <docText>Grigory Sizov, a former Soviet chemist who now teaches at a university in the USA, was asked what he could tell us about Boris Bugarov and his work in Cuba. Sizov said he knew Bugarov personally and had met him on a visit Sizov took to Moscow in 2002. Sizov said that Bugarov regards Castro as a buffoon but stays in Havana because he enjoys the climate and can make much more money there than in the former Soviet Union. Sizov also said that Bugarov showed him a picture of an attractive Cuban woman whom Bugarov said he planned to marry. Sizov said that Bugarov told him almost nothing about his work in Cuba. However, he said he was free to travel and had some very capable assistants who helped him with all sorts of things. Sizov said he guessed that Bugarov might still be involved in BW work but might also be involved in the distribution of narcotics. Finally, Sizov said he could not help noticing the several flashy diamond rings Bugarov was wearing when they met.</docText>

    <docText>Results of investigation of Abdul al Nami in Detroit. As requested, al Nami arrived at the Detroit office on the morning of 27 October, 2004. He was first asked about his association with Satam [alias Ronald] Derwish in Windsor, Ontario. al Nami said that they were friends and that they attended the same mosque in Detroit. He was then asked if he had corresponded with anyone in Marrakech, Morocco; he replied that he had never done so. Then he was asked if he had ever met or had any dealings with a person named Khaled Jehani [see DIA Report: 5 March, 2004]. al Nami replied that he had never heard of this person. Asked what the nature of his work was at Detroit Utilities Co. and how it involved the SCADA systems, al Nami replied that it was his job to make sure that his company made full use of the operational characteristics of these control and data acquisition systems. Asked if he ever accessed these systems from his home, al Nami replied that the demands of his job required that he do lots of work at home at nights and on weekends. Asked if he had ever heard about a project called "Black Ice", he said he had not. On evidence supplied by the various communications received regarding al Nami, a warrant to search his residence was approved by the court. Among the items found at his residence was a document describing the results of the "Black Ice" project that was designed to assess the various vulnerabilities associated with the SCADA systems. In addition, items associated with the construction of e-bombs were also found. al Nami is now in custody as further investigation proceeds.</docText>

    <docText>On 29 October, 2004 investigators went to the offices of the American Islamic Scholarship Fund located at 1721 Glade Dr. in Reston VA. There they interviewed the director of this fund, a man named Abdul Karim. Karim led the initial discussion and described how many deserving students of Islamic descent had been assisted by this scholarship fund since it was begun in 1991. Karim was first asked if this Fund did indeed receive the $48,000 scholarship donation made by a man named Adnan Hijazi on 14 September, 2004. Checking his records, Karim verified the receipt of this donation by Karim. Then Karim was asked for the names of persons who received money from this donation from Hijazi. Karim hesitated at first and then said: "Every now and then we receive money from donors who identify the students to whom the scholarship money should go. This happened in the case of Hijazi's donation." Checking his records again, Karim said: "HIjazi stipulated that $8,000 should go to each one of the following students: Wali Shakur, 224 Paulson Ave. CLifton, NJ; Hamza al Midhar, 1641 Pitkin Ave. Brooklyn, NY; Mounir Mzoudi, 2116 27th St. Laurel, MD; Mamoun Zammar, 1621 Charles Ave., Potomac, MD; Said Khadr, 6132 Broward Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL; Muhammed Dandani, 455 11th St., Miami Beach, FL." Karim then said that these amounts of money were sent to each of these persons on 17 September, 2004. Finally, Karim was asked if Hijazi had made any other donations to this fund in the past.  Karim said that his recollection was that Hijazi had contributed to the scholarship fund on two other occasions, once in 1999 and once in 2001.</docText>

On 25 October, Derwish was approached by officers at his place of work at Canada Eastern Airlines in Windsor. The officers said that Derwish agreed to accompany them to the RCMP main office in Windsor. During his interview Derwish denied having any contact with a person in Marrakech, Morocco [see NSA Report: 1 July, 2003; also see DIA Report: 5 March, 2004] and said he had no idea who "Abdul" was. Shown a photo of him [Derwish] in company with Abdul al Nami in Detroit on 18 July, 2004, Derwish said: "I never knew him by the name Abdul; I knew him as Ali. We have attended the same mosque in Detroit. "Subsequent court-approved investigation of Derwish's residence revealed an assortment of copper tubing, copper wires, batteries, and a supply of conventional explosives, all of which are components of an electromagnet ic pulse bomb. Derwish was held in custody and investigations continue.</docText>

    <docText>Further information about the background of Boris Bugarov is provided. From information gathered some time ago from Russian sources, Bugarov was born in 1950 in the town of Saratov and was trained in biology at Moscow State University. He appears to have joined the Vector institute around 1986 and he became an expert in developing aerosolized forms of biological weapons. It is believed Bugarov worked on aerosolized forms of India-1 smallpox and pneumonic plague. More recent sources say that Bugarov went to Cuba but then returned to Moscow sometime in 1992. He is reported to have divorced his wife in 1993 and has returned to Cuba. However, he still travels frequently to Europe, the Middle East and in South America. It is also known that Cuba has an active biological weapons program.</docText>
